\chapter{Background}

\paragraph \indent 
Accurate customer feedback is much sought after by commercial enterprises. The information is quite valuable and affects a comapny's
bottom line by aiding in the design of new products/services or helping to fix those that have not been well-received. This being the 
case, many companies invite their customers to submit reviews for products they have used. The format of these reviews can vary widely
from the \'Like\' format used by Facebook to lengthy surveys. Some formats, of course, are more used more in practice than others.

\paragraph \indent
One well-established format for customer reviews is that of five-star ratings paired with short text reviews. Feedback in this form
allows a customer to both give an overall rating for a product/service and provide meaningful commentary about the product/service. A 
problem related to the accuracy of the reviews comes up when feedback is formatted this way. The same numbered star rating will hold
different meanings for different customers and vary wildly. Furthermore, it has been observed that some star ratings will not match
the corresponding sentiment seen in the accompanying text commentary. For a commercial enterprise looking to collect accurate feedback
from its customer reviews, this should be a matter of much concern.

\paragraph \indent
To acquire more accurate information from customer feedback, we propose the removal of five-star ratings from these review formats
entirely. Instead, we propose that the star ratings be generated in a uniform fashion from the sentiment of the text commentary.

\subsection{Extraction from Google Play}
\subsection{Tagging}
\subsection{Phrase Extraction}
\label{subsection:phrase_extraction}
\subsection{Semantic Orientation}
In order to gain insight regarding the user's sentiment based on his or her review, we make use of the extracted phrases from Section~\ref{subsection:phrase_extraction} as a measure of a user's sentiment towards the application.

\subsubsection{Keywords}
Extending upon the work performed by Turney~\cite{Turney2001}, we used the following keywords to correspond to the each of the 5 stars of a customer review on the Google Play store. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item 1-Star: Awful
	\item 2-Stars: Bad
	\item 3-Stars: Okay
	\item 4-Stars: Good
	\item 5-Stars: Excellent
\end{itemize}
