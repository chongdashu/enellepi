The jump game is just broken, no matter which device Im using ralph will still fall through the branches to his death.

VLet me just state up front that this app is absolutely worth the $0.99, without question. The Fix-It Felix Jr. game included on here is absolutely stellar, and worth every penny. It's a fun throwback to classic arcade games, and wouldn't have felt out of place sitting among them. It's addictive, and a lot of fun, so that game alone gets five stars.  Unfortunately, as a whole, the other two games are much less entertaining. The Sugar Rush one is a play on Doodle Jump, but is extremely sluggish, and not much fun. The Hero's Duty one is a generic, mediocre dual joystick shooter, and while there's not much wrong with it on it's own, it doesn't exist in a vacuum, and there are much better games of that kind. There's also the promise of a Turbotime game coming soon, which will hopefully be more of a throwback to that style of arcade racer, and less of a generic flash game you'd expect on Disney's website.  Absolutely worth the money, don't hesitate to purchase the app, but understand that only one of the three games is really worth your time.

VLove that the game is only 99 cents. You get 3 good games, but I think i would rather it be 1 great game. Fix it Felix could have better controls. The shooter game is the most refined. The vine jumping game is the worst of the bunch. Should be interesting to see how the 4th "coming soon" racing game fares.

VVery clean and fun with the promise of more games added in the future. I really do like this app! That being said, please, update FF, Jr. With the only three phrases it needs: "I'm gonna wreck it!", "Fix it, Felix", and "I can fix it!". The app already  uses samples of Jane Lynch, Jack McBrayer, Silver man, and others, and adding those lines perfectly ports a nicely done game and probably satisfies 3/4 of all concerns. Smooth game play, but the controls need to be calibrated a bit. I Thanks!

VI will echo what others have said. The game needs more options for when you win, like 5m, 10m, or even making everyone bankrupt. I feel the exclusion of RR and utility properties cheapen the overall user experience, since it makes it easier to pass go and collect your salary. I do like the upgradable movers. Overall I feel like the game was made by some company that made just enough changes to the game so that they would not get sued.

VCompared to classic Monopoly, this new Millionaire version is a big disappointment.  The aim in this new game is to be the first to reach a million dollars.  The problem is that it comes up just too quickly.  Every turn about the board nets you $150,000, and properties never cost more than that.  I enjoy a good marathon run of Monopoly, trying to outsmart my opponent, but this simply requires you watch your money and try to spend less that the competition.  The other issue is with the digital version itself.  I don't like to believe that developers deliberately code cheating routines in to their games, but I can't help but feel they did with this one.  During one turn about the board I hit Go To Jail three times in a row.  Meanwhile my opponent threw multiple doubles and bought up property after property.  Once or twice I'd put it down to bad luck, but out of five consecutive games I won one.  That was against a single opponent on easy, and I'm a seasoned Monopoly player!  I could have done better things with the dollar I spent, but I was curious.  I'm glad I didn't stump up $15 for the real thing!

VSome people are complaining that this isn't real Monopoly. They're right. This is a combination of Monopoly and Monopoly Deal. EA has attempted to take the long game of Monopoly and break it down into something that can be played fairly quickly among friends and family. Sly Deal and Forced Deal cards allow players to steal properties (fixing the problem of nobody wanting to make a deal) while the Just Say No cards provide a counter to such tactics. Rent has gone up, making base properties more useful. Finally, the utilities, railroads, and taxation spaces have been done away with.  This game is meant to be passed between friends and family, and as a game for kids to play in the back seat it is PERFECT. Other reviewers have complained about compatibility issues, but it runs flawlessly on my Nexus 10, even if the impressive graphics seem a bit much for such a simple game.

VFun and addictive however there are a few problems. The main one being the size of the map because it's so small that it's impossible to obtain some items so you have to find a seed that has everything you need, for example I spent hours playing one seed before realising there was no lava, mushrooms, sugar canes, cacti and it was impossible to craft paper so I couldn't make books or bookshelfs. Despite this it's still a worthwhile game probably best on the market

VThis game is a lot of fun, especially after they added Creepers (I love Creepers). But the game is missing one vital piece: caves! There are no randomly generated caves in this game. Minecraft is missing half its title (I'm talking about the mine part of the title, just in case you couldn't tell.)! At first I thought there were no caves just because of the tiny world, or maybe just because the game wouldn't handle all the inside creatures inside a cave plus all the one's in the over world, but I played another Minecraft rip-off, and it had caves, with creatures inside! If you add caves, I'll give this game the five stars it deserves.

This will stop you from having big like 1000 block towers of obsidian :p

VI didn't fork over ¡Ì4.99 to have the app crash my whole phone every time I use it. I'm not sure if this is because of Android 4.2, which obviously isn't anything to do with the game, apart from it needing to be updated. Also, I'm still waiting on far rendering and the option to make the world a bit bigger. Water/Lava buckets and rails (anything to do with it) are still being waited on. Some phones are faster, and have better graphics that some computers, so the excuses not to have these are running out.

However I find that the game will not load if there is no Wi-Fi, which is really bad because you can play the iOS version without any Wi-Fi.

This game has kept me entertained for weeks and dozens of hours, and the same can't be said for a lot of ostensibly "better," higher production value, "serious" games.

It's not many years ago that you would have had to pay $29 dollars for a game of this quality on a Nintendo handheld. Any updates are OPTIONAL. You got the game you paid for and are not forced to buy the extras unless you feel they are worth playing. Perhaps they should put each addon out as a full new game on the store instead.

VI was excited to see updates but their approach to squeeze every cent out of their players has ruined it for me, I did like playing, it was a fun game.  Now, instead of adding levels to a version you already paid for, they now just add new "worlds" or whatever that you need to buy.  You start at 99¡Ë but you end up over $12 bucks now just to keep playing.  This micro-charging is getting out of hand.  Just play the free version, you get all the same levels and even in the paid version, you would need to buy the additional "worlds" anyways, so save your money.

VI absolutely love this game, played/completed it 5 times now! (on my own Acer iconia a200 tablet this time!).  'Where's My Water' features nice guy 'Swampy' and the not so nice 'Cranky', as well as 'Mystery Duck' and 'Lost Levels' games and a 'Where's my Perry' buying link. There is a good mix of over 400 easy and hard levels to play, plus many challenges, achievements, bonus and hidden levels for the whole family to enjoy; well worth paying ¡Ì4-5 for the full version and extra games, NO NEED TO PAY TO UNLOCK LEVELS!  My only comments: just 2 hidden games listed in achievements and nothing to show if/when completed, and repeat play on some levels is just too easy. No annoying adverts though, and devs are always super fast in bringing updates for android; no probs on or offline, awesome game!  NOTE: if you do opt to buy 'Perry' then I recommend closing 'Water' before you open/play it since my device completely froze up having the two games running together! ***30/10 update: bday present in bathtub from 22/9 update has disappeared, lost levels are still showing incorrectly as being 39/36 on individual games and 96/96 on main page, despite an email advising this!***

VI LOVE THIS GAME!!! I'm runing it on my Samsung Infuse. it run really smooth. the only issues that I have found is when I try to over right a save game it acts buggy and I have it hit the back button on the phone to get back to the game. Also after I try to save it will not let me use the exit game button on the home menu. Please try to find a solution. I know that my phone is not in the list of supported devises, but I thought I would give it a try. I am a diehard GTA fan and all  your help is appreciated.

Otherwise it's pretty perfect. The controls are great and graphics run smooth. A+  P.S. Yes the sound is choppy/clippy sometimes on the EVO LTE but it doesn't detract from the awesomeness.

Therefore Circle can be used for something else, We already have the left circle pad for weapon cycling. Thank you.

VI've tried very hard to enjoy this port, but these bugs are making it INCREDIBLY hard. From audio bugs during melee combat, pause menu glitches that prevent me from even quitting the game or changing the controls, having Claude suddenly start running towards the save house on a grid and not being able to stop, etc.  I can work with the controls, but not the bugs. And no, reinstalling did zilch.

Gameplay with the touchscreen was clumsy at best.  Button Assignment and Joystick/controller configuration would be key features.

Vjust three stars for now. it seems somewhat unstable, but after a reboot played and didnt crash. as it loads new areas, people, etc, it stutters quite a bit on my tf300t, but is pretty playable. If you could smooth out the caching issues and the stuttering, id give it 5 stars because it does play really well.

VI very much appreciate and enjoy this game but I am stuck on the mission that requires the use of the sniper rifle. The sniper rifle forces you to play inverted (regardless of what your settings are set at) and as a result, I can not get past the mission.   Adjustments and options for use with the sniper rifle would improve the quality of the game.   No complaints about performance on a nexus 7 jelly bean.

VAwesome job works absolutely great on VZW S3. Only one problem I have encountered and that is that when you go to save or even quit without saving the screen goes black and I end up having to hit Home and force close. With a game this size thats a bad bug to have since you have to start over every time you play. Not a big enough problem for me to uninstall/request refund tho just because in all other aspects this is a beautifully made game and plays well. I would request that Rockstar please update and fix.

VRockstar just wrote the manual on how to correctly port a game to android.	This game is worth it, just make sure your phone can run it. A direct port of the console classic that handles better than natively developed games. If you're rooted you can even use a PS3 controller. Other publishers should hire Rockstar to port their games over to android.

VGame is good, just like you remember, but controls lack precision, impossible to aim, driving is difficult with touch screen controls, even with analog setting on.  The biggest flaw I found so far is in the menu options.  When attempting to save, you can tap on the slot you want to save, but nothing happens.  And sometimes the screen will be blank, with the background present, but you can't see what you are selecting, this doesn't really matter because selecting something does nothing.  Please fix this.

Tried maybe 5 more times because I really wanted to play it,but had to remove the battery on all of them. Hopefully this will get fixed for my phone. 2stars but hopefully will be able to increase.
