VCrashes all the time (freezes and force closes).  Not many levels.  Not really different than other Angry Birds, just has pasted on Star Wars theme.  Not worth the hype.  Update:  Really disappointed.  Even purchased the Path of Jedi levels originally, and all the game does is lock up constantly.  Wish I could get the IAP refunded, this is crap.

Vl had an incline that this was going to be yet another of Rovio's get rich quick schemes, just like angry birds space where you have to buy everything in order to be able to complete the game, and I was right!  ***ROVIO PLEASE NOTE: YOU SHOULD NOT BE ADVERTISING THIS GAME OR ANY OF YOUR OTHER GAMES AS BEING FREE WHEN CLEARLY THEY ARE NOT - INCIDENTALLY, DO TRADING STANDARDS KNOW ABOUT THIS?!***  Additionally, I don't like the way in which Rovio are now plastering adverts for their new games all over other versions of angry birds without my even updating them either, its not only intrusive, but takes up memory that I'd rather use for other things. And that intro whilst loading, man, it takes far too long; gets pretty boring after a while too!  You really need to sort this out Rovio because a lot of fans are simply going to turn their backs on you if you don't get your act together - you only need to read the comments and see how your games are now being rated to see that your greed is loosing you custom!

VIts a nice, fun, and addicting game, but what would want me to actually pay for it would be if the paid version would have a game setting where you can make your own levels, costomize birds, and it would be cool if they found a way to play others online in a one on one battle game where you can choose to be on the pigs or the birds where you can choose a certain # of birds if you choose to be the birds, and if you choose the pigs you can set up your own fort with a limited # of items and pigs of your choice

VI've played this game in my tab and it works very well. I love this game. But in my brand new Xperia Tipo it freezes... I need to get that thrill of playing in tab in this phone. It would be great if it wouldn't freeze. I think an update fixing this problem in certainly necessary. Please do it.

A roll bar upgrade would also be nice, as the steep hills further down the track and the increasing distance between gas cans is hard enough. And be careful about upgrading too, as you can't downgrade, and the downforce on the racecar makes it difficult to drive when fully upgraded. But enough talk, back to the game!

VOverall, the game concept and design is brilliant... Simple yet challenging. I would like to point out a few things that I think should be changed. One is to have each vehicle make its own record. Two, I am always a fan of near indefinite upgrades so instead of an engine out of 12 or18, continue the upgrades with incrementally metered out gold prices. Lastly, when you either run out of fuel or have a downed driver, let the car come to a full and complete stop before going to the next screen.

No out-of-game purchases are nessisary to obtain all upgrades and the upgrades are priced so that its not impossible to upgrade the vehicles, but its not incredibly easy either.

VI like this game for passing time and as most we come to find,  the monster truck is very good.  However,  down grading options would help,  race car downforce max doesnt help entirely so far.   Also,  anyone else having difficulty at 2339m on Artic level,  i cant get up that hill?

VI've Maxed out all vehicles including bike. The bike is too wobbly at max and I would like to see a life bar incorporated, as in not ending from one minor neck injury, you'd get a chance to keep going or pick up health at points. Also sucks when you run out of gas in mid air and you're headed for a gas can but the game ends your progress before you reach it.

VYou should invest in new game modes. Such as a monster chasing you or something have time trials to see how far you can get in a certain time and also maps should get traps or someting to make the game more intresting. Also add customizing cars 2 the scenario I'm sure not everyone wants a jeep, monster truck, and a race car and definitely not just red and orange and even custom character would be nice and i would defiantly give this game five stars,so think about that as you are doing your next upgrade
