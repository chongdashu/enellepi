VLots of brainless, classic fun. No storyline, no ending, just fun; the way games used to be. My only gripe is that it keeps saying my Facebook name is an invalid username. This is likely due to a character limit on the input panel so I hope they fix it with the next update. In any case, the I haven't seen the movie yet but after playing this collection of classic inspired games I'll probably check it out.

VLevel 7 Problem
p1048
sg7
VHi...love the games, although I too would love Sugar Rush racing.  But that's not the problem.  Whenever I get to around Level 7 or so, the game just stops and sends me straight to the high score page. This has happened several times. Also, my score will be one thing, but the score that appears on the high score top 5 will be drastically lower. I even took a screen cap to give an example should anyone need clarification.  PLEASE fix it, Felix! I would hate to have to uninstall. I have a blast with the game, that is why it's so frustrating when it prematurely ends.  Thanks!

VAddicting and Fun

VThis is a fun and addicting game. I like the Fix it Felix Jr game the most. I suggest you add the candy race and have the main little girl glitch when we want to. That would be awesome. Great game. Also add the "I'm gonna Wreck it", voice and the "I can fix it",  before you fix it. If you do that I would give this game 5 stars.

VFix It Felix is great, with old style arcade graphics and sounds. Sugar Rush reminds you of Pocket God's Ooga Jump with a sugary twist and high quality candy canes. But my favorite is the tough to beat Hero's Duty. The controls were a little confusing at first, and they're difficult to get used to, but its a great challenge.

p1330

VAll 3 games found here have much better free versions, similar apps, only they play better and cost nothing.  The shooter is a bird's eye view and the only part of the trifecta worth ANY of your time, unfortunately you can't play it until you play wreck it first. The jump game is just broken, no matter which device Im using ralph will still fall through the branches to his death. Good movie but it appears Disney's penchant for making terrible games with movie titles has carried over to mobile gaming as well. And as mentioned, you cant log in with ur Facebook  account for whatever reason. NOT WORTH PAYING FOR.

VI don't seem to have too many complaints considering my phone, Droid X2. All games run terrific. However Sugar Rush lags a little here and there but not that bad. Love the other games on here too! Loading time is reasonably fast for me on this game as well. Love it! Worth .99¡Ë!

VGame is unplayable. It lags very, very badly. Great ideas on the games,  poorly executed. I would expect something better with a Disney name on it, but apparently not. If it didn't lag, I would rate it higher. Until they fix the lag problem, it is worth 1 star to me...

VIt runs a bit slow at first (probably a hiccup with my phone) but then it runs like a champ. The design is great and it's quite a bit of fun. I do have an issue in Fix it Felix Jr. though. When jumping from window to window, Felix tends to just jump wherever he wants before going the direction I tell him. It makes the game pretty hard. I'm not sure if it's just the phone I'm using (Evo 4g LTE) or not.

VOne Great Game, Two Mediocre Ones
p1716
sg7
VLet me just state up front that this app is absolutely worth the $0.99, without question. The Fix-It Felix Jr. game included on here is absolutely stellar, and worth every penny. It's a fun throwback to classic arcade games, and wouldn't have felt out of place sitting among them. It's addictive, and a lot of fun, so that game alone gets five stars.  Unfortunately, as a whole, the other two games are much less entertaining. The Sugar Rush one is a play on Doodle Jump, but is extremely sluggish, and not much fun. The Hero's Duty one is a generic, mediocre dual joystick shooter, and while there's not much wrong with it on it's own, it doesn't exist in a vacuum, and there are much better games of that kind. There's also the promise of a Turbotime game coming soon, which will hopefully be more of a throwback to that style of arcade racer, and less of a generic flash game you'd expect on Disney's website.  Absolutely worth the money, don't hesitate to purchase the app, but understand that only one of the three games is really worth your time.

p3321
sg7
VVery clean and fun with the promise of more games added in the future. I really do like this app! That being said, please, update FF, Jr. With the only three phrases it needs: "I'm gonna wreck it!", "Fix it, Felix", and "I can fix it!". The app already  uses samples of Jane Lynch, Jack McBrayer, Silver man, and others, and adding those lines perfectly ports a nicely done game and probably satisfies 3/4 of all concerns. Smooth game play, but the controls need to be calibrated a bit. I Thanks!

Control is very irritating on fix it felix, sometimes goes oposite direction than i am pressing. Othe than the controll Its worth the price for 3 games  in 1 the main game fix it felix is very fun, love the old school feel of the game, for a min i forgot i was playing on my phone and had one of those old school handhelds. Kinda surprised game is not more popular. Playing on evo 4g lte.

VThe "I'm Gonna Wreck It!!" one liner is missing from the game, I mean, was it really that hard to put it in the game?? That one bit ruins the presentation aspect of this game. Everything else is perfect.

VI could play "fix it" with no problems, but any other game took FOREVER to load. For as much memory as it uses you would think it would work great like "where's my water", but I am so disappointed I uninstalled. What's the point if I spend over half the time playing... waiting to load????

VI will echo what others have said. The game needs more options for when you win, like 5m, 10m, or even making everyone bankrupt. I feel the exclusion of RR and utility properties cheapen the overall user experience, since it makes it easier to pass go and collect your salary. I do like the upgradable movers. Overall I feel like the game was made by some company that made just enough changes to the game so that they would not get sued.

Vif you like monopoly don't waste your money on this game. it's some tiny board with crappy pieces new properties and some really annoying get a card everytime you land on something bull. It takes up 3/4 of a gig and all of that memory seems to be used on superfluous sparkles on stuff and ornately texturizing the playing table and the center checkering. This is about as close to actual monopoly as McDonalds monopoly so if you wanted to play monopoly find a different app!

VI played against 2 computer players and had two entire sides of the board saturated with hotels. Only one computer player even had any houses; a grand total of 3.  And I still lost.  This game has no incentive to build monopolies.  Just hang out and hope that you get a few good chance cards.  At least that's what's been working for the computer.  Very disappointing.

VThe graphics are  cute. But i cant get past thirty seconds of playtime and the game crashes. It doesnt even start a crash report. The program just closes without notification or error statement. And i paid for this? Oh and before you tell me to free up some more memory i will let you know that there are 26 out of 32 gigs available for use. Do me a favor e.a. Dont respond to this posting unless you plan to refund me or fix the problem.

VFun game but it needs more customization, game ends way to fast for only needing $2 million, need to be able to change how you win, like eliminate the other players to win and free parking rule.  Needs to be more like the other monopoly game they have where you can customize almost everything, it would be more fun.

VNot bad for $0.99 but the AI is really bad. Even on easy mode, the computer buys up all property while you land on go to jail or chance cards that force you to shell out all of your money. After most all property is taken, you only land on theirs. This happens like clockwork on all games for me so it gets kind of boring fast.

VA Big Disappointment
p6980
sg7
VCompared to classic Monopoly, this new Millionaire version is a big disappointment.  The aim in this new game is to be the first to reach a million dollars.  The problem is that it comes up just too quickly.  Every turn about the board nets you $150,000, and properties never cost more than that.  I enjoy a good marathon run of Monopoly, trying to outsmart my opponent, but this simply requires you watch your money and try to spend less that the competition.  The other issue is with the digital version itself.  I don't like to believe that developers deliberately code cheating routines in to their games, but I can't help but feel they did with this one.  During one turn about the board I hit Go To Jail three times in a row.  Meanwhile my opponent threw multiple doubles and bought up property after property.  Once or twice I'd put it down to bad luck, but out of five consecutive games I won one.  That was against a single opponent on easy, and I'm a seasoned Monopoly player!  I could have done better things with the dollar I spent, but I was curious.  I'm glad I didn't stump up $15 for the real thing!

VSome people are complaining that this isn't real Monopoly. They're right. This is a combination of Monopoly and Monopoly Deal. EA has attempted to take the long game of Monopoly and break it down into something that can be played fairly quickly among friends and family. Sly Deal and Forced Deal cards allow players to steal properties (fixing the problem of nobody wanting to make a deal) while the Just Say No cards provide a counter to such tactics. Rent has gone up, making base properties more useful. Finally, the utilities, railroads, and taxation spaces have been done away with.  This game is meant to be passed between friends and family, and as a game for kids to play in the back seat it is PERFECT. Other reviewers have complained about compatibility issues, but it runs flawlessly on my Nexus 10, even if the impressive graphics seem a bit much for such a simple game.

Gave her a rematch and she won the first one... so even for someone who's good at monopoly it mixes things up, brings a little more chance into the picture so she can actually win a few haha.

VI love the game, it's portable Minecraft! However, it needs caves, and rare stones, as there's no point mining without these. Also, add mine carts, as navigating is too slow. Finally, worldwide multiplayer, but that is less important than the in-game updates. Will change to 5 stars when these come.

VFun and addictive however there are a few problems. The main one being the size of the map because it's so small that it's impossible to obtain some items so you have to find a seed that has everything you need, for example I spent hours playing one seed before realising there was no lava, mushrooms, sugar canes, cacti and it was impossible to craft paper so I couldn't make books or bookshelfs. Despite this it's still a worthwhile game probably best on the market

Maybe a item requirement list for missions..details on how to make other branch off items.. Also could you make every survival make have all resources on em.. Come across.some random made maps  that don't have diddley squat.. But overall a top notch game for all platforms..

VThe 5.0 update is awsome but if you put in redstone I would rather buy this instead of the computer.also would like to add caves, what about joining other servers it would make the game so fun to play with other people around the world, add name titles and can talk to people with your mic when you join other servers.

VAfter the release of 0.5, there was a new item called the nether core reactor, I was really exited at first, I found out that you need 4 gold blocks to get it to work which totals up to 36 ingots. It took me 3 days to gather them all, but I finally did it. I found out, after you use the reactor, the gold turns to obsidian. Please replace the requirements of gold to iron (as I think it is more reasonable).

VCrucial Features Missing
p10578
sg7
VI do like the new update (skeleton archers, spiders, bone meal, bow & arrow) but two crucial features are STILL MISSING: beds, chests, and the rest of the mobs that are in the PC version.  Also, giving the zombies the ability to destroy wooden doors/windows would be a nice touch.

VCaves! Caves, I say!!
p11188
sg7
VThis game is a lot of fun, especially after they added Creepers (I love Creepers). But the game is missing one vital piece: caves! There are no randomly generated caves in this game. Minecraft is missing half its title (I'm talking about the mine part of the title, just in case you couldn't tell.)! At first I thought there were no caves just because of the tiny world, or maybe just because the game wouldn't handle all the inside creatures inside a cave plus all the one's in the over world, but I played another Minecraft rip-off, and it had caves, with creatures inside! If you add caves, I'll give this game the five stars it deserves.

VThe only thing bad about it is that  you need to make it BIGGER. Also there are no caves (very useful). And the sheep don't re-grow their wool. And I can't find seeds. You should also make commands. Other than those things... It is perfect!!! :D

VThis app is still amazing :D I was getting a little bored of v0.4.0 and was joking around yesterday with my friends about having v0.5.0 when I didn't then it came out today :p just a tip for people that read this, for the nether reactor, build it in one spot and keep using it in the middle of the obsidian room it makes since it doesn't change the room then other than filling up the holes after you activate it. This will stop you from having big like 1000 block towers of obsidian :p

VI didn't fork over ¡Ì4.99 to have the app crash my whole phone every time I use it. I'm not sure if this is because of Android 4.2, which obviously isn't anything to do with the game, apart from it needing to be updated. Also, I'm still waiting on far rendering and the option to make the world a bit bigger. Water/Lava buckets and rails (anything to do with it) are still being waited on. Some phones are faster, and have better graphics that some computers, so the excuses not to have these are running out.

VI love this game, I am anticipating the new update the only problems I have are that you cant climb waterfalls, I wish to see bigger worlds, underground caverns and caves, more ores, you also cant mine redstone, but this is a great start to the full complete version on the pc thank you

VThe nether reactor is kind of cool but that and the bug fixes were the only good thing I thought was good I this 5.0 update. Plus the updates take forever!!! It is also missing some features. For example caves, bigger world generation, armour,and BUCKETS. If you could just add these or just caves this game get a 4 or 5 star rating.

VThe game is good, but has its problems, if there are more then one character and you dont have any way to id your target, you just have to guess and shoot, wich can cause you to fail. Keeps crashing when i launch, so have to start it multiple times, the last rifles aim sucks orange..really? Hard to see the numbers agains a white wall, and ofcourse its a episode game...it just ends..long story short decemt game, good consept alot of anoyinh shizz, and greedy developer

VThis game is no doubt capable of making new levels and more stories/storyline..you could even do with difficulties and make like moving shots for hard and maybe crazy wind patterns. Its just way too short to have to pay, knowing it could easily go farther. Come on guys let's see some more good work.

VAsus Transformer Pad Infinity  I achieved all weapons fairly early into the game (which says a lot seeing as how this is the shortest game I've ever purchased for android). Weapons are also lacking the ability to upgrade. It would bring new depth to have to hold your breath in order to steady your shot.

VBut...I'm totally stuck on the time for a promotion mission, I've reloaded it almost 20 times now, I've shot both guys clean, dirty and everywhere in between, the targeting is totally off.  The wind is negative 61.5 but with the guy on the left if i try and fire correctly it misses, but if i fire in the opposite it hits him, but killing neither of them clears the mission!

VTo begin this game is not groundbreaking or whatsoever, just aim and shoot, in some levels aiming is a little tricky but 95% is peace of cake. There are things that makes the game pretty unique though,cutscenes underground boxing, all in all decent game but needs more levels and modes.

VAt times the glitches made it hard to go on especially in cut scenes or the text missing letters. I would have liked more of a longer story also, I am not sure if this is a to be continued game.  Other than those things it was well worth the dollar and is a great story for a game.

VAs the title suggests, this game is pretty fun and the is better than most games available. That being said, it does have a tendency to lock up and doesn't force the screen to stay on during cut scenes. Also, in some of the missions there are no clues to who your target is so you take a 50 50 shot in killing.g the wrong person.

VI really enjoyed this game. The concept and gameplay are great. I like how you have to adjust for distance and wind. The use of stick figures, so you have to pay extra attention to body language and other details, is a nice touch also. My only real complaint is that this game is waaaay to short. Even with the DLC, the game is over right when it starts to get challenging. All-in-all it's well worth playing. Just don't expect to spend much time on it.

VThis game is a lot of fun, it's pretty simple, but enjoyable and doesn't require a lot of time for loading and all that crap. Great for a quick little bit of down time while stuck in line or something.

VI bought the game, love the game, and now the new update won't install.  I uninstalled the game, removed other games, and the game continues to say "not enough room on device"...  yet I have over 1.5 GIGS of internal storage and 8 Gigs of SD card storage.  So thanks, now I've lost all the progress (I had already beaten all the levels in the game) and can't even get the game back installed.  This is on a Samsung Tab 7".  On my Samsung Captivate it does install, which brings my rating up to 3 stars.

VAwesone game. Worth the money. Edit: this is beyond a joke. I have had this PAID version now for over a year and they have never added ANY extra swampy or cranky levels since they brought this out. It is absolutely ridiculous that they bring out 'new' levels when infact it is just a rehash of the previous levels. Its total bull**** that we pay for a game and get no real actual levels added. Edit- another update and no actual real levels added other then the rehashed versions. Is it possible to give minus.

VLike many reviews here, I find the game very enjoyable and so do my kids. However I find that the game will not load if there is no Wi-Fi, which is really bad because you can play the iOS version without any Wi-Fi. This may also explain when playing, the poor battery life too. When fixed will change to 5 stars!!!! Now been fixed so 5 stars from me :-)

p17068
sg7
VSure, the water physics may not be entirely realistic, but who said video games had to be realistic to be good? This game has kept me entertained for weeks and dozens of hours, and the same can't be said for a lot of ostensibly "better," higher production value, "serious" games. Plus, I like the variety of expandable alternate game modes. Admittedly, this adds a few $ to the ticket, but it's still a ton of cheap fun.

VDisney strikes gold with this game. The graphics are great, and it even has a cute little story. The beginning levels are easy to get all three ducks on, but become much more challenging. If you're tired of angry birds, at least try the free version. My favorite part of this game is that it's constantly updated for free.

VAll the people complaining here should be reminded just how much gameplay they got for their 99c. It's not many years ago that you would have had to pay $29 dollars for a game of this quality on a Nintendo handheld. Any updates are OPTIONAL. You got the game you paid for and are not forced to buy the extras unless you feel they are worth playing. Perhaps they should put each addon out as a full new game on the store instead.

VI was excited to see updates but their approach to squeeze every cent out of their players has ruined it for me, I did like playing, it was a fun game.  Now, instead of adding levels to a version you already paid for, they now just add new "worlds" or whatever that you need to buy.  You start at 99¡Ë but you end up over $12 bucks now just to keep playing.  This micro-charging is getting out of hand.  Just play the free version, you get all the same levels and even in the paid version, you would need to buy the additional "worlds" anyways, so save your money.

VAll they did was add one little level. After all these months they should have some actual new chapters and it should be obvious most people aren't going to pay so much for bonus lvls  Well after literal months of waiting it looks like they are done with this game new update took away the promise of adding more free levels and it seems they are committed to pimping their overpriced rehashes of other levels, despite peoples discontent; sigh- it was fun while it lasted

VDon't waste your money
p18824
sg7
VUsed to be great but no new swampy or cranky levels in several months. I have the paid version but the only updates are geared towards making you buy other similar games, which I don't like as much and am not interested in. For months there's been an icon noting more levels are coming but the last update even removed that while adding nothing but a youtube video. If you're looking for something to play long-term, don't waste your money on this game. I'll be certain to avoid disney games in the future.

VI don't like Disney games, but where's my water is great game. Physics of the water is cool to look at and the green glop cooler in my opinion. I love the levels they're so fun and challenging. This game is well made this game is definitely a 5 out 5 game. ;).                             Written by Andrew  age 12

VBeware! It's Addictive!
p18959
sg7
VOh such addictive fun!  My daughter asked for help, and now it's on my phone, too. Maddening, challenging but not too difficult overall, and funny. When I get frustrated, it's nice to be able to skip level and come back. And Cranky is fun, too. New levels keep the game fun, and hidden levels are a nice surprise.   ...love all the new features from frankenweenie to begind the scenes!

VI absolutely love this game, played/completed it 5 times now! (on my own Acer iconia a200 tablet this time!).  'Where's My Water' features nice guy 'Swampy' and the not so nice 'Cranky', as well as 'Mystery Duck' and 'Lost Levels' games and a 'Where's my Perry' buying link. There is a good mix of over 400 easy and hard levels to play, plus many challenges, achievements, bonus and hidden levels for the whole family to enjoy; well worth paying ¡Ì4-5 for the full version and extra games, NO NEED TO PAY TO UNLOCK LEVELS!  My only comments: just 2 hidden games listed in achievements and nothing to show if/when completed, and repeat play on some levels is just too easy. No annoying adverts though, and devs are always super fast in bringing updates for android; no probs on or offline, awesome game!  NOTE: if you do opt to buy 'Perry' then I recommend closing 'Water' before you open/play it since my device completely froze up having the two games running together! ***30/10 update: bday present in bathtub from 22/9 update has disappeared, lost levels are still showing incorrectly as being 39/36 on individual games and 96/96 on main page, despite an email advising this!***

VFive out of five thumbs up. If you have a Nexus 7 tablet the graphics, frame rate, and controls are fantastic. If you install the game for the first time and encounter an issue where you have no sound, try uninstalling and then reinstalling, this worked for me. I remember back in 2001 I purchased this game the day it came out. This brings back some good memories.

VIll never forget playing this for the first time and being entertained for hours before even doing the second mission. Seeing this again on the phone and being able to play it nearly as easily as when it was on console is amazing ( besides the auto-aim which could use some work). Easy 5 stars, 4 at least with the aiming issues and not having cheats available.

VPlay testing?
p19779
sg7
VIt's GTA3, which is a great game but I'm disappointed that Rockstar didn't play test it with these controls. Some missions, such as "Silence the Snitch" are frustrating to the point of not playing.  Safely this extends to trying to collect packages too - climbing the bridge in Staunton is ridiculously fiddly.

VExcellent controls and superb game. No graphics or sound problems.  Aldo the accelerometer has switched axis - unplayable with accelerometer (I don't like it anyway).  First time I was downloading the game I accidentally stopped it after 50% finished. Game didn't recognized that is not downloaded completely. (sound files ware missing) I was able to play but thee was no sound in the game (only in menu). After reinstall OK.

VI LOVE this game! Touch controls are easy and simple and you can't beat driving a banshee around blasting out MSX! Problem I'm having on the Galaxy S2 is that it only seems to want to work at home where the wifi is connected, it keeps freezing straight away when I'm on the go, even in flight mode. Apart from that its well worth the cash!

VToo bad nothing prevents you from buying games that are not compatable for your phone. I'm not sweating it, though, cause I'm getting a Boost Evo in a couple weeks and I'm sure it will work fine. Use the web to find out if your phone is compatible before you buy, cause buy the time you install all the extra content your refund time could be done and your stuck paying the major companies for a game you can't even use.

VI played this game on my ps2 and it was a whole new type of game for me at the time. The game still feels solid after all those years. The only thing i dislike is the auto targeting system for guns. Its not bad but it targets everyone, wich can be kind of a hassle when you need to kill a target. This game is worth your money. And don't let the auto targeting scare you off, because you are going to have one hell of a time.

VI LOVE THIS GAME!!! I'm runing it on my Samsung Infuse. it run really smooth. the only issues that I have found is when I try to over right a save game it acts buggy and I have it hit the back button on the phone to get back to the game. Also after I try to save it will not let me use the exit game button on the home menu. Please try to find a solution. I know that my phone is not in the list of supported devises, but I thought I would give it a try. I am a diehard GTA fan and all  your help is appreciated.

Also, increase your Display>Sleep to After 30 minutes.  Then, install the game to ensure that you get all the necessary files to avoid issues.  If you've already downloaded it and have issues, go into Settings>Apps, clear Cache, Clear data, Force stop (if lit otherwise go to step next), Uninstall and reinstall game.

VSo the driving controlls take some getting used to, but the fact that you can reconfigure where you want the on screen touch controlls from the options menu is a game saver. I just got to the first mission that requires you to use a sniper rifle... So thatll be interesting. But yeah. Great game. No problems thus far. Looks great playin on my note.

VAccelerometer is off by 90 degrees on the Galaxy Nexus and you can't use it to drive vehicles without having the screen vertical and unplayable.  Sensitivity of looking around / analog stick is too high and should have a slider to adjust like other options (Draw distance, etc). Audio lags by 3 seconds and input is delayed. This is not functional.

VGreat game
p20859

VRuns generally smooth on my thunderbolt,  but know that there's a big download, mine took ten minutes,  so no refund,  and if you have a single core like me,  it won't be perfect.  The menus don't always work, and i had to move the game to sd BEFORE DOWNLOADING THE EXTRA FILES.  Know your device's limitations.

VPlayed for about 20 mins, smooth framerate although occasional pauses in the cut scenes. What's stopping me from continuing though is that I get no sound at all once I'm in the game. I get sound in the initial opening titles, but after that nothing.  Shame because the sound is such a big part of the game for me that I don't want to replay it in silence. Nexus 7.

VHard to get installed properly
p20956
sg7
VIt took me three install/unintsalls to get it to install on the nexus7 properly. It would install but then not launch or just disappear. The solutions seems to be to keep the tablet awake during the 400mb game file download. Once I did that it installed and opens fine. It runs amazing, better than it did on the PC I had when the game was new. Very smooth and the controls aren't bad.

VThere needs to be a longer window to cancel a purchase.  The in game downloader exceeds the 15 minute return window.  I wanted a refund because the game controller doesnt work properly.  If you are having sound issues, just uninstall and reinstall.  Make sure you let the in game installer finish completely. That worked for me at least.  I will rate this game higher once the controller issues are worked out.

VSo might be more stars if rockstar would actually fix their game. I keep getting an error message when I connect to my wifi and it says the time is not correct on my wifi so cant download? So you think rockstar customer support helps? Nope its been over 2 weeks and I havent heard anything/a response. And you would also think that a big developer would like to keep their customers happy, but it doesnt seem that way. Add game controller support as well like everyone is asking for! Dang! how hard is it to make a game/give good customer support. I work in retail and I can tell you its not that hard. btw I have an asus transformer prime so plenty enough juice to play this game

VNot really playable on Xperia Play. Average FPS is about 20. Additionally the tards who ported this game changed up the controls for no reason. Game needs improved FPS wise on the Xperia Play and the controls need to have an an option for classic controls or at least let us map the Xperia Play gamepad.  Update: Added vibration support, changed controls to classic configuration, and added stabilization on Xperia Play. Framerate is much better, however still dips at times. Make framerate more stable for 5*

VAwesome app. It truly works just like GTA. I was a little skeptical about how this game would work. Yes, I'm giving it 5 stars. I did have issues downloading the additional data to my Toshiba Thrive running Android 3.2, but after I deleted a ton of games that I don't play that were setting there taking up internal memory, the data downloaded with ease. The troubleshooting guide said to have at least 1 gig of free space so the files could have space to unzip. I had to have 2.5 gig of space to get it downloaded and installed. After installation, everything worked out great.

VExcellent game. Since I never owned Sony systems I never got to finish it. It runs smooth as butter on my SGS3. Easy to play and customsizable control placement. Game downloaded in 4 seconds. Best 5 bucks I've ever spent. Much love for rockstar.

Just installed on a Galaxy Note as well.  5 Stars.  For those claiming that sounds in play does not work : make sure that the game is fully downloaded.  It's nearly 600 mb.  It will play even if not completely downloaded,  but with missing components,  like audio.

VI played this game a lot with my ICS galaxy nexus, it's got a few bugs here and there. The major 2 bugs I noticed were the scope in game is inverted with no option to change it (and super slow, which makes the 8ball mission nearly impossible). The other is that after paying for a few minutes sometimes the game no longer accepts multi-touch. I can't turn while pressing the gas.

VA great job has been done in porting the classic GTA 3 to mobile platform, however on a quad core device such as the one X there are some frame rate issues due to lag which is most definitely down to the optimisation of the game, rockstar should fix this!

VI've played this game on playstation 2 and it plays about the same. graphics are nice and you can change the car driving controls if you dont like it. The only hangup I have is the ability to play with cheats. I enjoyed that in the past. Great game overall.

VNice Job
p22333
sg7
VThis is an incredible port from a console game to a mobile app. I still can't believe I'm playing GTA III on my phone. My only gripe was with the installation: that initial ~500MB download should run in the background instead of forcing you to have the game open, and restarting if you hit the Home button and come back. Otherwise it's pretty perfect. The controls are great and graphics run smooth. A+  P.S. Yes the sound is choppy/clippy sometimes on the EVO LTE but it doesn't detract from the awesomeness.

VWhen I first downloaded this on my GS3 it apparently Did not work.  I reinstalled,  waited another 5 minutes for download,  restarted my device and it still did not work.  It took soo long that my refund time ran out.  I tried my last time on this.  I repeated the steps and BOOM!  It starts to work and runs flawlessly.  But I do have to admit that it's very heavy on your device.  It takes about 3 seconds to just open the app. Some glitches in the menu but it doesn't bother me.

p22905
sg7
VThe driving in the game is fluid and the controls are good. But when it comes to shooting you tap one button to aim and shoot at once. So you will likely hit other you don't intend to hit. And missions with the sniper are brutal. There is no option to turn off the invert when in the scope. And it does not move fast. Making the final few mafia missions just impossible and frustrating.

If you experience loss of sound, as I did, it's probably because all the files didn't download completely.  Try again (took me about 5 attempts).  Game runs smooth as silk with all effects on.  3 stars due to install issues.

VControls are very quirky on smaller devices.  Save files are easily corrupted (loads previous saves, cars disappear from garage etc.) Especially save slot 1.  Last update messed up menu.  Cannot load saved game while playing, can only load at startup.

VWhen I go to save, or at the menu to restart a mission or not, half the time I won't be able to select any thing. Everything is greyed out. Please fix. Xperia Play. Also, using circle to shoot is VERY awkward and I feel it should be changed to R, and aiming should be L. Therefore Circle can be used for something else, We already have the left circle pad for weapon cycling. Thank you.

VGreat Game, Horrible Port
p23374
sg7
VI've tried very hard to enjoy this port, but these bugs are making it INCREDIBLY hard. From audio bugs during melee combat, pause menu glitches that prevent me from even quitting the game or changing the controls, having Claude suddenly start running towards the save house on a grid and not being able to stop, etc.  I can work with the controls, but not the bugs. And no, reinstalling did zilch.

VI purchased this app as the sole game that I was going to play on my Android device (Asus Transformer Prime).  I was excited that a throwback game was on Android.. and one that I loved at that.  Gameplay with the touchscreen was clumsy at best.  Button Assignment and Joystick/controller configuration would be key features.  I am having a glitch happen at the game where the missions are grand theft auto and small arms...can't get further in the game....

I also cannot load my briefs or states becuase either I cant click on it ( enter it) or I cant see  any of the worlds. Game play is epic and works fine. It just the menus that doesnt work for me.

VThis really utilizes the dual core this phone provides. Running on maximum settings without a hitch, and it looks just like what it did on the PS2 all those years ago. Easy controls, and doesn't completely tear up your battery. Sniper rifle aim sensitivity could be better, but I finally beat that mission.

Hopefully this will be fixed as would have given 5 were it not for this bug  Update, nexus 7 owners. Uninstall and then set your screen timeout to Max. Re-download and make sure you do not touch the screen whilst it downloads additional content. I did this and now have full sound :-) seems silly but it works.

p24188
sg7
VLooks great and runs smooth on the nexus 7 with the graphics up full but once in the game there is no sound, can hear sound in the menus so must be a bug. Hopefully this will be fixed as would have given 5 were it not for this bug  Update, nexus 7 owners. Uninstall and then set your screen timeout to Max. Re-download and make sure you do not touch the screen whilst it downloads additional content. I did this and now have full sound :-) seems silly but it works.

VWas disappointed to learn that this game needs an additional 400 mb of stuff downloaded when you start it for the first time. Don't let your device sleep during the second download or you'll have no sound and need to to uninstall everything and start over. Also, you have to quit the game from the menu, or your device will remember that GTA is on, when it isn't. Touch controls take some practice. Otherwise this is a fun port of a good game.

VIts a fantastic game. No doubt its a must have for android game collection. Your gonna love it I promise. But before downloading MAKE sure to have at lest 1GB of free space other wise your not going to have a good experience truth me. I already went through it. LG 4G from MetroPCS.

p24881

VI very much appreciate and enjoy this game but I am stuck on the mission that requires the use of the sniper rifle. The sniper rifle forces you to play inverted (regardless of what your settings are set at) and as a result, I can not get past the mission.   Adjustments and options for use with the sniper rifle would improve the quality of the game.   No complaints about performance on a nexus 7 jelly bean.

Vjust three stars for now. it seems somewhat unstable, but after a reboot played and didnt crash. as it loads new areas, people, etc, it stutters quite a bit on my tf300t, but is pretty playable. If you could smooth out the caching issues and the stuttering, id give it 5 stars because it does play really well.

VGreat game. Needs Update - Jelly Bean
p25065
sg7
VI very much appreciate and enjoy this game but I am stuck on the mission that requires the use of the sniper rifle. The sniper rifle forces you to play inverted (regardless of what your settings are set at) and as a result, I can not get past the mission.   Adjustments and options for use with the sniper rifle would improve the quality of the game.   No complaints about performance on a nexus 7 jelly bean.

VAccelerometer issue on smartphones
p25085

VAccelerometer steering is not working on smartphones.  Seriously there must be millions of users who play this on their smartphones. Still rockstar cannot fix cannot fix an issue they know about.  If they would happen to fix it this game would be 5 stars.

Vok....it plays
p25105
sg7
Vjust three stars for now. it seems somewhat unstable, but after a reboot played and didnt crash. as it loads new areas, people, etc, it stutters quite a bit on my tf300t, but is pretty playable. If you could smooth out the caching issues and the stuttering, id give it 5 stars because it does play really well.

VAwesome job works absolutely great on VZW S3. Only one problem I have encountered and that is that when you go to save or even quit without saving the screen goes black and I end up having to hit Home and force close. With a game this size thats a bad bug to have since you have to start over every time you play. Not a big enough problem for me to uninstall/request refund tho just because in all other aspects this is a beautifully made game and plays well. I would request that Rockstar please update and fix.

VRockstar just wrote the manual on how to correctly port a game to android.	This game is worth it, just make sure your phone can run it. A direct port of the console classic that handles better than natively developed games. If you're rooted you can even use a PS3 controller. Other publishers should hire Rockstar to port their games over to android.

VHaving had issues with crashes and no sound, I emailed rockstar and got a reply. If you clear the data, losing your saves, and re download but do not let the device sleep nor click, you should be fine. Worked for me.

VAwesome job works absolutely great on VZW S3. Only one problem I have encountered and that is that when you go to save or even quit without saving the screen goes black and I end up having to hit Home and force close. With a game this size thats a bad bug to have since you have to start over every time you play. Not a big enough problem for me to uninstall/request refund tho just because in all other aspects this is a beautifully made game and plays well. I would request that Rockstar please update and fix.

VGame is good, just like you remember, but controls lack precision, impossible to aim, driving is difficult with touch screen controls, even with analog setting on.  The biggest flaw I found so far is in the menu options.  When attempting to save, you can tap on the slot you want to save, but nothing happens.  And sometimes the screen will be blank, with the background present, but you can't see what you are selecting, this doesn't really matter because selecting something does nothing.  Please fix this.

VI was really excited when I noticed the 0.97¢æ price on the game. Bought it and was all really to expel nostalgia out of my pores. Game starts, "oh man,this is so fluid! This is gonna be so awesome!" 1minute in the game stops, no force close request, no buttons respond... had to remove the battery. Tried maybe 5 more times because I really wanted to play it,but had to remove the battery on all of them. Hopefully this will get fixed for my phone. 2stars but hopefully will be able to increase.

VI got this game thinking it would work fine on an old device. Unfortunately, it did not. So I upgraded, then had instantaneous entertainment right on my tablet. If you're wondering, yes, it has cheat codes, though you need a physical keyboard to enter them. Other than that,  absolutely enjoy this game.

VGame is good, just like you remember, but controls lack precision, impossible to aim, driving is difficult with touch screen controls, even with analog setting on.  The biggest flaw I found so far is in the menu options.  When attempting to save, you can tap on the slot you want to save, but nothing happens.  And sometimes the screen will be blank, with the background present, but you can't see what you are selecting, this doesn't really matter because selecting something does nothing.  Please fix this.

VI got this game thinking it would work fine on an old device. Unfortunately, it did not. So I upgraded, then had instantaneous entertainment right on my tablet. If you're wondering, yes, it has cheat codes, though you need a physical keyboard to enter them. Other than that,  absolutely enjoy this game.

VI was really excited when I noticed the 0.97¢æ price on the game. Bought it and was all really to expel nostalgia out of my pores. Game starts, "oh man,this is so fluid! This is gonna be so awesome!" 1minute in the game stops, no force close request, no buttons respond... had to remove the battery. Tried maybe 5 more times because I really wanted to play it,but had to remove the battery on all of them. Hopefully this will get fixed for my phone. 2stars but hopefully will be able to increase.

VTweak your graphics settings!

VWas getting a lot of crashes/force closes on my Galaxy S2. However once I realised that my graphics settings should have been on maximum, I've had no problems at all! Tbh I didn't realise you could tweak them at first. No idea why performance would be worse on lower settings though, but it certainly was the case

VStill a great game after all these years. Touch controls work better than expected. My only knock is the background textures. The surroundings look too plain. Get it!

VThis is a very well done port. Runs extremely smooth on the SIII and the controls are well thought out. Only thing missing are the cheats!  Well done, Rockstar.
