	Title: Awful ads!
	Text:  I was fine with having to exit ads on previous Angry Birds
	       games, but this is a two -step requirement. You have to expand 
	       first and then exit the ad, and for me, using a Samsung Galaxy 
	       S3, it will only take me to the ad link when I touch the X. 
	       Broken ad exit button will not let me play. Uninstalling.

	NOTE: The title and review were quite negative. We gave it a positive
	      star-rating. Fail.

	      Apparently, the phrases "not let", "only take", and "then exit"
	      all have close proximity to "excellent" according to Google.
	      This drove the polarity of the generated star-rating to be
	      maximally positive against all common sense.

	Title: A long time ago but somehow in the future.....
	Text:  This game is very good both gameplay wise and graphically. The 
	       formula still works from previous games ,but each time there's 
	       a different twist. This time in the Star Wars verse im only 
	       about ten levels in and I can say I really enjoy playing this 
	       game and you can't beat the price FREE! Anyone who's looking 
	       to burn some time should download this app as it is very fun 
	       and addicting.

	NOTE:  This review is positively oozing positivity. So, why did
	       we generate a 1-star score. The answer lies in the number
	       of hits correlated to poor the phrase "very good" had. There
	       were many. This drove the star-rating straight down to 1.0.

	Text:  Really loving this game I'll be going to get the paid version

	       a Star Wars fan so HAPPY \xab\xc4\xa2\xd0 updated New levels 
	       cool Love this game thanks

	NOTE: This review isn't even remotely negative. The reason why this
	      review was assigned a 1-star rating from us is that,
	      apparently, the phrase "Really loving" is strongly correlated
	      with "poor" and not "excellent". Thus, this review was
	      tagged as being maximally negative against all reason. Oh, boy.
	      This Google-version of PMI-IR is really not working out.

	NOTE:  This review seems like 4-star material more than anything. The

	       series, in general. I can't call this a draw, though, knowing

	Title: Good
	Text:  Brought back interest in angry birds again after a year or so

	NOTE:  This review was definitely lukewarm. A 3-star rating would
	       have been more appropriate than the 4-star rating. ÉWe gave
	       the review a 1-star rating. Fail.

	       The reason for this low rating apparently is that the phrase
	       "angry birds" has high proximity to "poor" according to
	       Google. This leads me to believe that we should add the names
	       of the apps we are analyzing into a corpus of neutral

	NOTE:  Failure once again. The title would have helped. The text
	       of the review should have given us mostly negative polarities.

	       The only phrase that was analyzed by our code was the phrase
	       "too big". According to our algorithm, this phrase is
	       massively positive for some reason. Its proximity to excellent

	NOTE:  In this case, the review deserves a 4-star rating, probably,

               3 stars XD overall great game
	
	NOTE:  We were completely off on this one. Perhaps, this is because
	       we aren't picking up misspelled words. The text of the review
	       made it seem like the game should have been given a 4-star
	       rating by the author. (They have a grip about getting 3-star
	       ranks on levels of Angry Bird) Perhaps we can say that our
	       rating draws with that of the author.

	       The reason for the 3-star rating on our part appears to be
	       because we had no hits from Google from the phrases we were

	** The above examples were chosen because the original, observed
	   star-rating differed from the one we generated by at least 2
	   stars.

  Possible Improvements
	- We should definitely incorporate titles into our analysis.
	- We should add app names to a small corpus of neutral phrases.
	  ("Angry Birds" comes out as extremely negative)
	- We should find a better method of mining PMI data.
		- The Google method will get us blocked quickly.
		- The Google method does not give us enough data. (most of
		  the hits are 0)
	- We should see if granting polarity to emoticons helps at all.

PAID (pmi_paid50.dat)
- This data is incomplete. Shortly after starting up the script to collect
  this data, we were blocked by Google. Only 3 of the 50 entries in this
  data set were collected. The bottom 47 entries all have zero hits for all
  words. Thus, pmi_paid50.dat is largely unusable.
+ Before the above observation was made, pmi_paid50.dat was put through our
  analysis scripts. We generated acceptable star-ratings for the first 3
  entries which is rather nice.



Version History
------------------------------------------
3rd Attempt:	Accuracy=22%	(pmi_free50.dat)
- Previously, lograt2star.py would calculate a star-rating for the
  log-ratio of each phrase in a review. These values would then be averaged
  together to make the final star-rating for the review. This did not
  reflect the method used in the PMI-IR paper. In the paper, the log-ratios
  were averaged first, then they were assigned a star-rating. By switching
  to the method used in the PMI-IR paper, the accuracy increased by 6%.

2nd Attempt:	Accuracy=16%	(pmi_free50.dat)
- Initially, lograt2star.py was not producing star ratings that were
  multiples of 0.5. It was only producing integer star values. Changing
  this doubled accuracy.

1st Attempt:	Accuracy=8%	(pmi_free50.dat)
- Lots of bugs successively fixed in later versions of the lograt2star.py
  script.
