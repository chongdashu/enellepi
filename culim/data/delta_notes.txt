FREE (pmi_free50.dat)
- The discrepancy between the star-ratings we generated for some entries in
  pmi_free50.dat and the actual observed star-ratings can be quite 
  significant.

  Examples:
	[0]
	[2]
	[3]
	[4]
	[5]
	[6]
	[8]
	[27]
	[28]
	[36]
	[37]
	[39]
	[42]
	[43]
	[44]
	[45]
	[46]
	[49]

	* The above examples were chosen because the original, observed
	  star-rating differed from the one we generated by at least 2
	  stars.

PAID (pmi_paid50.dat)
- This data is incomplete. Shortly after starting up the script to collect
  this data, we were blocked by Google. Only 3 of the 50 entries in this
  data set were collected. The bottom 47 entries all have zero hits for all
  words. Thus, pmi_paid50.dat is largely unusable.
+ Before the above observation was made, pmi_paid50.dat was put through our
  analysis scripts. We generated acceptable star-ratings for the first 3
  entries which is rather nice.



Version History
------------------------------------------
3rd Attempt:	Accuracy=27%	(pmi_free50.dat)
- Previously, lograt2star.py would calculate a star-rating for the
  log-ratio of each phrase in a review. These values would then be averaged
  together to make the final star-rating for the review. This did not
  reflect the method used in the PMI-IR paper. In the paper, the log-ratios
  were averaged first, then they were assigned a star-rating. By switching
  to the method used in the PMI-IR paper, the accuracy increased by 11%.

2nd Attempt:	Accuracy=16%	(pmi_free50.dat)
- Initially, lograt2star.py was not producing star ratings that were
  multiples of 0.5. It was only producing integer star values. Changing
  this doubled accuracy.

1st Attempt:	Accuracy=8%	(pmi_free50.dat)
- Lots of bugs successively fixed in later versions of the lograt2star.py
  script.
