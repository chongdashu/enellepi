text : It is fun for a little while then you realize the gas is not gas but a timer and doesn't work properly and the break is not a break but is reverse and that is not good either. Let the fuel gauge be a fuel gauge based on gas , not time. And you need motor vehicles in more tracks. The only thing I use this game force to help put me to bed.

text : Game is fun, for ten maybe fifteen minutes. My touch screen isn't analog so when I press gas or brake its game over and not fun. If their was a better balance for gas and brake, and upgrade made noticeable differences then maybe. Hopefully gets fixed would be a great time sync.

text : Fun game, but sometimes it is still loading on startup, so when you try to avoid danger it doesn't register. AND after saving up 10,000 coins by playing multiple games, the so-called "permanent" Resurrection Wings go away after the first use. They should either be cheaper or they should clarify "permanent."

The game is exciting albeit for first few days . Reached 32x and can't avoid skipping . Its just too fast to concentrate .

text : I've Maxed out all vehicles including bike. The bike is too wobbly at max and I would like to see a life bar incorporated, as in not ending from one minor neck injury, you'd get a chance to keep going or pick up health at points. Also sucks when you run out of gas in mid air and you're headed for a gas can but the game ends your progress before you reach it.

text : You should invest in new game modes. Such as a monster chasing you or something have time trials to see how far you can get in a certain time and also maps should get traps or someting to make the game more intresting. Also add customizing cars 2 the scenario I'm sure not everyone wants a jeep, monster truck, and a race car and definitely not just red and orange and even custom character would be nice and i would defiantly give this game five stars,so think about that as you are doing your next upgrade
