VIt's a great looking port and controls surprisingly well using just the touch screen. I would give it five stars except that once in a while the controls just stop working for a few seconds. I also get a lot of frame drops after playing it for for a bit no matter what video settings I choose. If those issues are fixed in a future patch I would gladly change my rating to five out of five.

VI've tried very hard to enjoy this port, but these bugs are making it INCREDIBLY hard. From audio bugs during melee combat, pause menu glitches that prevent me from even quitting the game or changing the controls, having Claude suddenly start running towards the save house on a grid and not being able to stop, etc.  I can work with the controls, but not the bugs. And no, reinstalling did zilch.

VGame graphics is awesome but shooting is slow, inverted aiming is on when it is off, the steering on analog doesn't work properly and the sniper doesn't  move as fast as a console game play. It's a challenge just to accelerate at a normal speed. Hats off to Rockstar to get this game out there. Just tweek it a little. Hope to see GTA 5 on the market.

Vjust three stars for now. it seems somewhat unstable, but after a reboot played and didnt crash. as it loads new areas, people, etc, it stutters quite a bit on my tf300t, but is pretty playable.

VI was really excited when I noticed the 0.97¢æ price on the game. Bought it and was all really to expel nostalgia out of my pores. Game starts, "oh man,this is so fluid! This is gonna be so awesome!" 1minute in the game stops, no force close request, no buttons respond... had to remove the battery. Tried maybe 5 more times because I really wanted to play it,but had to remove the battery on all of them. Hopefully this will get fixed for my phone. 2stars but hopefully will be able to increase.
