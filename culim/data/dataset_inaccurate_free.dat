S'Fun game, but sometimes it is still loading on startup, so when you try to avoid danger it doesn\'t register. AND after saving up 10,000 coins by playing multiple games, the so-called "permanent" Resurrection Wings go away after the first use. They should either be cheaper or they should clarify "permanent." Uninstalling.'

S"You should invest in new game modes. Such as a monster chasing you or something have time trials to see how far you can get in a certain time and also maps should get traps or someting to make the game more intresting. Also add customizing cars 2 the scenario I'm sure not everyone wants a jeep, monster truck, and a race car and definitely not just red and orange and even custom character would be nice and i would defiantly give this game five stars,so think about that as you are doing your next upgrade"
