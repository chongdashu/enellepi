text : I've tried very hard to enjoy this port, but these bugs are making it INCREDIBLY hard. From audio bugs during melee combat, pause menu glitches that prevent me from even quitting the game or changing the controls, having Claude suddenly start running towards the save house on a grid and not being able to stop, etc.  I can work with the controls, but not the bugs. And no, reinstalling did zilch.

text : I was really excited when I noticed the 0.97¢¾ price on the game. Bought it and was all really to expel nostalgia out of my pores. Game starts, "oh man,this is so fluid! This is gonna be so awesome!" 1minute in the game stops, no force close request, no buttons respond... had to remove the battery. Tried maybe 5 more times because I really wanted to play it,but had to remove the battery on all of them. Hopefully this will get fixed for my phone. 2stars but hopefully will be able to increase.

text : just three stars for now. it seems somewhat unstable, but after a reboot played and didnt crash. as it loads new areas, people, etc, it stutters quite a bit on my tf300t, but is pretty playable. If you could smooth out the caching issues and the stuttering, id give it 5 stars because it does play really well.

text : Game graphics is awesome but shooting is slow, inverted aiming is on when it is off, the steering on analog doesn't work properly and the sniper doesn't  move as fast as a console game play. It's a challenge just to accelerate at a normal speed. Hats off to Rockstar to get this game out there. Just tweek it a little. Hope to see GTA 5 on the market.
title : Gotta tweek the gameplay.

text : It's a great looking port and controls surprisingly well using just the touch screen. I would give it five stars except that once in a while the controls just stop working for a few seconds. I also get a lot of frame drops after playing it for for a bit no matter what video settings I choose. If those issues are fixed in a future patch I would gladly change my rating to five out of five.

text : Awesome game works well my only complaint is that there's no way to change the settings to make the buttons bigger sometimes it can be kind of hard to play. If they could fix that this would be a 5 star app no doubt

text : Game is good, just like you remember, but controls lack precision, impossible to aim, driving is difficult with touch screen controls, even with analog setting on.  The biggest flaw I found so far is in the menu options.  When attempting to save, you can tap on the slot you want to save, but nothing happens.  And sometimes the screen will be blank, with the background present, but you can't see what you are selecting, this doesn't really matter because selecting something does nothing.  Please fix this.

text : Awesome job works absolutely great on VZW S3. Only one problem I have encountered and that is that when you go to save or even quit without saving the screen goes black and I end up having to hit Home and force close. With a game this size thats a bad bug to have since you have to start over every time you play. Not a big enough problem for me to uninstall/request refund tho just because in all other aspects this is a beautifully made game and plays well. I would request that Rockstar please update and fix.

If you're wondering, yes, it has cheat codes, though you need a physical keyboard to enter them. Other than that,  absolutely enjoy this game.

text : Was getting a lot of crashes/force closes on my Galaxy S2. However once I realised that my graphics settings should have been on maximum, I've had no problems at all! Tbh I didn't realise you could tweak them at first. No idea why performance would be worse on lower settings though, but it certainly was the case
