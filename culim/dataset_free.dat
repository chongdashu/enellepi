VI was fine with having to exit ads on previous Angry Birds games, but this is a two -step requirement. You have to expand first and then exit the ad, and for me, using a Samsung Galaxy S3, it will only take me to the ad link when I touch the X. Broken ad exit button will not let me play. Uninstalling.

VI paid for path to the Jedi and ads free. I have no ads but the Jedi level won't unlock Google play says I purchased the package but nothing from rovio also happened when I paid for angry birds items. This is a good game I changed it from 2 to 3 stars after Hoth update and will go to 4 if they have some more updates to the level area or fix Path to the Jedi. If there is a mistake I want it fixes please. Everyone else gets my items to me. Please help or refund my money. More content & fix - 5 stars!

Vl had an incline that this was going to be yet another of Rovio's get rich quick schemes, just like angry birds space where you have to buy everything in order to be able to complete the game, and I was right!  ***ROVIO PLEASE NOTE: YOU SHOULD NOT BE ADVERTISING THIS GAME OR ANY OF YOUR OTHER GAMES AS BEING FREE WHEN CLEARLY THEY ARE NOT - INCIDENTALLY, DO TRADING STANDARDS KNOW ABOUT THIS?!***  Additionally, I don't like the way in which Rovio are now plastering adverts for their new games all over other versions of angry birds without my even updating them either, its not only intrusive, but takes up memory that I'd rather use for other things. And that intro whilst loading, man, it takes far too long; gets pretty boring after a while too!  You really need to sort this out Rovio because a lot of fans are simply going to turn their backs on you if you don't get your act together - you only need to read the comments and see how your games are now being rated to see that your greed is loosing you custom!

VI can't rate gameplay because I can't play any of the levels. Eventually I'm getting an Ipad so I wont have to worry about android for apps like this but you should fix the instant crash. I looked at reviews for my phone only and its almost all crashes. Please fix this. I love angry birds and I'm excited to see what you can do to star wars. I'm not necessary a fan of star wars but you guys could help if I could play the game.

VBest Angry Birds Game Ever
p2315
sg7
VI really enjoy this game. I never did like any of the Angry Birds Games but when I saw there was an Angry Birds Star Wars I immediately download. Being a fan of Star Wars I could not refuse this.  It's fun and change ginger. Like I said before Best Angry Birds Game Ever. Can't wait for more updates for the Stars Wars version. This one is the only one I will play. I'm glad they came out with an Angry Birds Star Wars version. Also you should add Endor to this game! Add more star wars settings.

VGreat game, wonderful abilities by the birds. It takes u to the start wars world very nicely. U can use the light saber, force push, pull and the blaster. Chewy is rather a useless character here which is the only disappointing factor.... But according to a true start wars fan, its arguably the best game ever!

VLove this game but u need to fix the lag. I can't even count the # of times I've died becuz of this. Has never happened once on NY iPod. Very frustrating when u try to jump, turn, or slide n u can't. Cuz I lags...causing u to die. I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't for that.

VWas very good the first time i installed. Now it keeps hanging suddenly often causing me to lose my progress. Too often when i'll just be in reach of my next objective it hangs, starts suddenly and makes me fall.off or bang into something. :'( :-( :-[ :-/

VThe title says it all; what more could you say? One little bug I've noticed though: Sometimes when you get the speed boost and you are on the rocky path, your player just does not take the turn and goes straight, without any way for you to control it; and neither you or your phone are causing it... Happened to me a couple of times : but the app still deserves the five stars for sure :D

VButtery smooth sometimes, then can be not so smooth or worse be too laggy even if you close other running apps. Please make the game optimized for the majority of Android devices and not just the high ends. Really love the game but thinking of uninstalling it.

VIt's pretty fun, but it's a pretty huge bummer when I'm at 2500 meters and suddenly I can't jump anymore. As a result, this game is impossible to play for more than like a minute. Might be okay if I didn't have to start at the very beginning after every fall.

VI played it on an iPod touch before but it looks so much better on my HTC One X. Only problem is that the main menu is cut off a bit. But nothing bad. Also it sometimes lags with HTC Sense.

VI'm not a big gamer but this is the best game out there.. I can play on for hours and hours.. It's a great game just to stay occupied and whenever I'm at work and every break that I get I am playing Temple Run.. Sometimes there is a little bit of a lag but  overall it's a great game.. Good job developers.. I could I would give it 10 stars....

VSo, ive tried to make numerous purches (5 to be exact) for 200,000 temple coins and the game wont acknowledge it. I have well over $1,000 in the bank and ive triple checked the card details....i would like either a refund or i would like the 1,000,000 coins i bought. Outside of that fiasco, the game isnt bad. I am really tired with these payments though.

VFun game, but sometimes it is still loading on startup, so when you try to avoid danger it doesn't register. AND after saving up 10,000 coins by playing multiple games, the so-called "permanent" Resurrection Wings go away after the first use. They should either be cheaper or they should clarify "permanent." Uninstalling.

VDon't waste your coins on switching over to different runners. They don't have any extra feature or power. And don't spend your coins on wallpapers. . Its simply not worth it. Of course. The game is exciting albeit for first few days . Reached 32x and can't avoid skipping . Its just too fast to concentrate .

VThis is a great game. Fun to play and challenge your friends. But i have experienced a bug while playing. When i get the boost while playing the game most of the time it works like how it should i.e the player automatically moves left or right and i don't have to control it. But sometimes it just goes straight out of the road instead of going left or right. Happened to me like 5 times and it is really irritating at times. So please fix this bug.

So a helmet or something that makes him cool(er). But further it is a very good game and maybe a tutorial how to control the vehicles, but thank you very much for this game :) :D :} :]

VBest Side Scrolling Driving Game
p11786
sg7
VThis is a very fun and technical driving game. I love how overly dramatic the person's movements are, getting thrown around in the car and such. My only suggestion is if once i purchase an upgrade for the car, if i could go back and sell that one upgrade if i wish. That would be great.

Also a great way to pass time but I think it would be great if the airtime amout increased quicker because its hard to make money and when the updates come in it takes alottt of money to uprade vehicles.

VExtremely addictive game. The constant updates make the game worth playing. As other posts have stated, a simple color option for the vehicles or different avatars would be fun. Still play even with all the upgrades to try to beat my high score. Can't wait for more games from Fingersoft, I think they could make an addictive game very similar to indestructo tank that would not be too much different from this. Also, a network challenge between players would make for a great challenge, or a global leaderboard

VI can't stop playing this game! It be nice to create your own character, instead of a scruffy guy with his hat on backward.   A roll bar upgrade would also be nice, as the steep hills further down the track and the increasing distance between gas cans is hard enough. And be careful about upgrading too, as you can't downgrade, and the downforce on the racecar makes it difficult to drive when fully upgraded. But enough talk, back to the game!

VI love this game great time waster but it would be way better if it had an in-game shop where you can buy a large fuel tank or boosters I find with the monster truck fully done I find I'm skipping most of the fuel cans and running out of petrol maybe a shop where you can buy more fuel space or boosters and accessories with the gold attained during the game. just a suggestion!

VA few suggestions...
p12492
sg7
VOverall, the game concept and design is brilliant... Simple yet challenging. I would like to point out a few things that I think should be changed. One is to have each vehicle make its own record. Two, I am always a fan of near indefinite upgrades so instead of an engine out of 12 or18, continue the upgrades with incrementally metered out gold prices. Lastly, when you either run out of fuel or have a downed driver, let the car come to a full and complete stop before going to the next screen.

p13112

VI've been playing this game for the last week non stop, it is very addicting. No out-of-game purchases are nessisary to obtain all upgrades and the upgrades are priced so that its not impossible to upgrade the vehicles, but its not incredibly easy either. The last thing is that this app is very light on the battery (wheras other apps on my MyTouch 4G can drain battery within a half a hour) and still has smooth and impressive graphics. 5 stars from me!

It has everything thing you coulda asked for. I mean gas and brake, what else do you need. The graphics are among the most innovative I've seen, and the controls are seamless, gas then brake, brake then gas ... anyway you press the only two buttons, it works!

Vcool game! Motorcycle is 2 hard 2 control. I think the more expensive the vehicle is, the easier it should b 2 handle and control. Keep the challenge in the courses not the vehicle. Gas should only run out when u push the throttle. Other than that, awesome game!

p14140

VI've Maxed out all vehicles including bike. The bike is too wobbly at max and I would like to see a life bar incorporated, as in not ending from one minor neck injury, you'd get a chance to keep going or pick up health at points. Also sucks when you run out of gas in mid air and you're headed for a gas can but the game ends your progress before you reach it.

VYou should invest in new game modes. Such as a monster chasing you or something have time trials to see how far you can get in a certain time and also maps should get traps or someting to make the game more intresting. Also add customizing cars 2 the scenario I'm sure not everyone wants a jeep, monster truck, and a race car and definitely not just red and orange and even custom character would be nice and i would defiantly give this game five stars,so think about that as you are doing your next upgrade
